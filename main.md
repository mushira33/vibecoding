# Data Reconciliation Between Oracle and Hive Metastore in Azure Delta Lake

## Introduction

This document outlines the design for a system to reconcile data counts between Oracle and Hive Metastore in Azure Delta Lake, focusing on attribute-level comparisons. The goal is to ensure data consistency and integrity across these platforms.

## Objectives

- **Data Consistency:** Ensure that data between Oracle and Hive Metastore matches at both the record and attribute levels.
- **Error Identification:** Detect discrepancies and provide detailed reports for resolution.
- **Automation:** Develop an automated process to perform regular reconciliations.

## Data Sources

### Oracle

- **Description:** Relational database management system used for transaction processing.
- **Data Characteristics:** Structured data with defined schemas and constraints.

### Hive Metastore in Azure Delta Lake

- **Description:** Metadata repository for data stored in Azure Delta Lake, facilitating SQL-like queries.
- **Data Characteristics:** Schema-on-read, supporting structured and semi-structured data.

## Reconciliation Approach

1. **Data Extraction:**
   - **Oracle:** Use SQL queries to extract data.
   - **Hive Metastore:** Utilize HiveQL or Spark SQL to retrieve data.

2. **Data Standardization:**
   - **Schema Alignment:** Ensure both data sources have consistent schemas, including data types and naming conventions.
   - **Data Formatting:** Standardize formats (e.g., dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format) to facilitate accurate comparisons.

3. **Attribute-Level Comparison:**
   - **Record Matching:** Identify unique keys to match records between the two data sources.
   - **Value Comparison:** Compare values of each attribute for matched records to detect discrepancies.

4. **Discrepancy Reporting:**
   - **Logging:** Record all discrepancies with details on the attribute, record identifier, and nature of the mismatch.
   - **Visualization:** Generate reports or dashboards to present reconciliation results for stakeholders.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Data Extraction and Transformation:**
  - **Apache Spark:** For processing large datasets and performing transformations.
  - **SQL Queries:** To extract data from Oracle and Hive Metastore.

- **Data Comparison:**
  - **Python/Pandas:** For attribute-level data comparison and analysis.

- **Reporting:**
  - **Jupyter Notebooks:** To create interactive reports.
  - **Power BI/Tableau:** For dashboard visualizations.

## Automation Strategy

- **Scheduling:**
  - **Apache Airflow/Azure Data Factory:** To orchestrate and schedule reconciliation tasks.

- **Alerting:**
  - **Email Notifications:** Trigger alerts when discrepancies exceed predefined thresholds.

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Data Volume:** Efficiently handling large datasets to ensure timely reconciliation.
- **Data Latency:** Accounting for delays in data replication between systems.
- **Error Handling:** Implementing robust mechanisms to handle and log errors during the reconciliation process.

## Conclusion

Implementing this reconciliation system will enhance data integrity between Oracle and Hive Metastore in Azure Delta Lake. By automating the process and focusing on attribute-level comparisons, the organization can maintain consistent and reliable data across platforms.
